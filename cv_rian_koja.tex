\section{Professional Summary}
I've graduated and started my career as an Aerospace Engineer, specializing in Navigation, Guidance, and Control Systems with a special interest in mathematics. I've always worked with development, validation and deployment of software systems, in research and development contexts. I moved to the finance industry in 2022 where I've employed past and new skills in quantitative finance, designed and implemented automated systems for data acquisition and trading, developed quantitative models, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate technology and research. Through my career, I've been regarded as a committed, reliable and trustworthy professional, often being given access to sensitive data and systems.

\section{Hobbies}
\cvitem{Lottery Numbers Project}{
  Developed a Rust project available on \href{https://github.com/RianKoja/lottery_numbers}{GitHub} to select lottery numbers using combinatorial and behavioral principles, optimizing for partial wins and payout rates. The project ensures no two games share three numbers and avoids commonly picked low numbers, increasing the chance of unique prizes. Currently with 49 stars on GitHub.
